   Welcome to PyEdPro. The motivation for this project was to create a modern
multi-platform editor. Simple, powerful, configurable, extendable.

 This project is a successor of pyedit, after porting it to GTK3.

Working platforms currently are: Win 7 .. Win 10 Centos 6 .. 7 Ubunto 14 ... 16
(all linux platforms) Msys, Msys2, Mingw, Raspberry PI ... practically
 anywhere PyGTK can run.
  
   PyEdPro.py has macro recording/play, search/replace, functional navigation,
comment/string spell check, auto backup, persistent undo/redo, auto complete,
auto correct, syntax check, spell suggestion ... and a lot more.
   
   It is fast, it is extendable, as python lends itself to easy tinkering. The
editor has a table driven key mapping. One can easily edit the key map in
keyhand.py, and the key actions in acthand.py

The default key map resembles gedit / wed / etp / brief. Full ASCII; 
 Any fixed font can be configured. 

  See KEYS file for the list of keyboard shortcuts or press F3 in the
editor or look at the file in pyedlib/KEYS.

  On initial start, PyEdPro shows a left pane and a top pane. The left pane 
is for function summary and the top pane is for double view of the same file.
(to see the caller and the callee) These panes can be hidden with the mouse by 
dragging on their handle, or by the key combination Alt-Q (Shift-Alt-Q for
the left pane) 

 PyEdPro remembers a lot about your editing. Loaded files, cursor positions,
fonts, font size, colors, search strings, goto numbers, undo / redo info.
It is all stored in ~/.PyEdPro. You may safely delete that directory to start
 PyEdPro with no memory of what has been done.

  Starting PyEdPro with no command line arguments will put you back to the 
 previous session, exactly as you left off.

 The editor will work on Windows, and can open UNIX and Windows files
transparently. It will save the file as the current platform's native 
convention dictates.

  Developer's note: in order to make PyEdPro multi platform, we save
the configuration info into a SQLite database in the ~/.PyEdPro directory.

 Contributors are welcome. Requires pygtk.

UPDATES:

   PyGTK 3 changed a lot of things ... workig on port

   PyGTK 2.24 (latest at the time of writing) has a bug on not delivering
double click to the window. Down-graded to 2.22.x, works flawlessly.

   Lots of functions added. Attempted to make it tablet friendly. Drag
on screen now does what you would expect from a tablet.

   My laptop keyboard broke, so I added Ctrl-H for left arrow j, k, l
for the other arrows (like in vim) so the defective keys are substituted 
with vi compatible navigation.

  On request of one of my clients, I needed to create a time sheet. So I
extended PyEdPro to create a work log. 

The log contains the following elements:

 Start time, End time, Time of file Open, time of file Save. 
The files have been created to be machine parsable.
 
 Example log entry:
 
Action: Started PyEdPro
On: Tue May 08 16:44:37 2018

Action: Ended PyEdPro
On: Tue May 08 17:14:21 2018
Time diff: 1784 0:29

 Example timesheet entry:
 
 Action: Opened File C:\msys32\home\peterglen\esp\esp-code\wclock\v010\common\v000\httpd.c
On: Thu Jun 28 14:49:13 2018
Delta: 0
Date: 1530211753 httpd.c Opened

Action: Closed File C:\msys32\home\peterglen\esp\esp-code\wclock\v010\common\v000\httpd.c
On: Thu Jun 28 14:49:18 2018
Delta: 5
Date: 1530211759 httpd.c Closed

 The files are located at ~/.PyEdPro/log/account.txt and ~/.PyEdPro/log/timesheet.txt
 (the '~/' stands for your home directory. On windows it is 
 C:\Users\<UserName>\ ...) Example: 'C:\Users\PeterGlen\.PyEdPro\'

UPDATES:

  Implemented multiple clipboards. The key combination Ctrl-0 to Ctrl-8 switches
clipboard buffers. Switching to buffer 9 (Ctrl-9) yields the sum of all clipboards 
from 1-8. This is useful on collecting parts of the file, and unifying it 
with one keystroke.  (Like collecting function headers.) Th first clipboard buffer
(Ctrl-0) is the same as the OS clipboard.

UPDATES:

  sep/16/2018   Port to GTP3 started
  oct/10/2018   Port stable, almost done
