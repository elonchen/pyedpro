                              INSTALL
                              
   Just type 'make install'. You need to be root to install PyEdPro.
(sudo ./install.py will work just as well)
      
  PyEdpro requires GTK3, PyGobject and related libraries. Most distros
come with them pre-installed, so PyEdPro.py should run on most any system 
including Linux, Windoze and Macz. One of the motivations, of course is to 
have the same text editor on all platforms.

 (PyEdPro is extensively tested on Linux and Windows)

To install pygtk3 on python 2/3 issue msys32:

    pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-gtk3 mingw-w64-i686-python2-gobject \
                 mingw-w64-i686-python3-gobject
 
Or on 64 bit:   (support incomplete as of dec/2018)

    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-python3-gobject python-gi-cairo

 
   To display the keymap and documentation, PyEdPro needs pangview.py (included)
     
  If you do not have root access, PyEdPro will run from any directory, provided
that the subdirectory pyedlib is under the directory PyEdPro.py is in.

 You may also install PyEdPro in the user's private bin directory 
 (if it is in the user's path) with the command like cp -a * ~/bin

Additional tweaks neede for different platforms:

  On Unix you may need to execute dos2unix pyedpro.py to allow it to run from 
command line. 

  Some platforms will need the 'python-gi-cairo' module. The syptom is that the 
editor's text field remains blank. Pydit will issue appropriate messages for the
missing library, install it with:

  sudo apt install python-gi-cairo
  
  
  
  

Enjoy.
