                              INSTALL
                              
   Just type 'make install'. You need to be root to install PyEdPro.
(sudo ./install.py will work just as well)

      
 PyEdpro requires GTK3, PyGobject and related libraries. Most distros
come with them pre-installed, so PyEdPro.py should run on most any system 
including Linux, Windoze and Macz. One of the motivations, of course is to 
have the same text editor on all platforms.

 (PyEdPro is extensively tested on Linux and Windows)

come with them pre-installed,
 
To install pygtk3 on python 3 issue:

      pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-python3-gobject
 
 To display the keymap and documentation, PyEdPro needs pangview.py (included)
     
  If you do not have root access, PyEdPro will run from any directory, provided
that the subdirectory pyedlib is under the directory PyEdPro.py is in.

 You may also install PyEdPro in the user's private bin directory 
 (if it is in the user's path) with the command like cp -a * ~/bin

Enjoy.
